## Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful method for improving large language model (LLM) outputs by supplementing them with relevant retrieved data. This project tests and showcases RAG with Hugging Face's ecosystem, providing insights into how external knowledge can improve model performance.

## Features

- **Hugging Face Integration**: Uses Hugging Face Transformers and Datasets.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Combines retrieval mechanisms with LLM inference.
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Add your own retrieval corpus for experimentation.
- **Extensible Codebase**: Easily modify for more advanced RAG workflows.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AybTGH/LLM_RAG.git
   ```
## Usage

### 1. Prepare the Dataset:
- Add your custom dataset or use Hugging Face datasets for retrieval.
- Preprocess the data if necessary to ensure compatibility with the RAG pipeline.

### 2. Run the RAG Test:
- Open and execute the `test.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or your preferred IDE to test the RAG pipeline.

### 3. Modify Parameters:
- As the project evolves, parameters such as the model and retrieval settings will be configurable in separate files like `config.py` (coming soon).
- For now, adjustments can be made directly within the notebook.

## Future Enhancements

- Additional files for modularity (e.g., `config.py`, dataset loaders, etc.).
- CLI-based execution scripts.
- Support for more advanced RAG workflows.
